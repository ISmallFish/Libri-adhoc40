# Libri-adhoc40
Libri-adhoc40 is a synchronized speech corpus, which collects the replayed Librispeech data from loudspeakers by ad-hoc microphone arrays of 40 strongly synchronized distributed nodes in a real office environment. Besides, to provide the evaluation target for speech frontend processing and other applications, it also recorded the replayed Librispeech data in an anechoic chamber.

## Introduction
The Libri-adhoc40 dataset is built on the ‘train-clean-100’, ‘dev-clean’, and ‘test-clean’ corpora of Librispeech, which contains about 110 hours of US English speech from 331 speakers.
