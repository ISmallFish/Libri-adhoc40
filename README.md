# Libri-adhoc40
Libri-adhoc40 is a synchronized speech corpus, which collects the replayed Librispeech data from loudspeakers by ad-hoc microphone arrays of 40 strongly synchronized distributed nodes in a real office environment. Besides, to provide the evaluation target for speech frontend processing and other applications, we also recorded the replayed speech in an anechoic chamber.
